      "weatherInfo": "Hawaii has two seasons – winter (ho'oilo) and summer (kau wela) – and temperatures don't change drastically the way they do in the mainland United States. During the day, expect temperatures in the mid-70s to the mid-80s all year around. Expect lows in the winter months (November to March) to be around 60 degrees. The Hawaiian winter is also considered the rainy season, and flash floods are not uncommon. You can expect to see lots of rainbows as the rain clears.",
